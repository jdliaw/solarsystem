#### Please grade the version tagged v1.0
    Controls:
      R - reset
      UP - rotating heading up by N degrees
      DOWN - rotating heading down by N
      LEFT - rotating heading left by N
      RIGHT - rotating heading right by N
      1~9 - set N
      A - attach camera to planet 2
      D - detach camera from planet 2
        (UDLR also works while camera is attached to planet)
    To fly around solar system:
      SPACE - move camera forward by N units
      M - move camera backward by N
      , - move camera left by N
      . - move camera right by N
